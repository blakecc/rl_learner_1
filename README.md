Building on Andrej Karpathy's Pong learning algorithm. Intention to eventually build a policy gradient learner with either Keras or TensorFlow learning, and incorporate an evolutionary algorithm to find optimal neural network structures.

pg_karpathy.py is mostly Andrej Karpathy original code, but updated for Python 3.
